# Basic-Website-Structure

All we know that there're some really cool frameworks like bootstrap or many others out there. However, I fell sometimes that for a certain projects I prefer to use my own stuff. 

Some time ago ago I started to create a basic structure for one of my projects. But then I think, hey why not to share this code with the community. So... I decide to make it public and avaliable for other developers. My idea is to add new modules and features in the future.

I'm starting this repo to create  a basic template for my websites: including mobile menu, footer and different elements. I know many frameworks and projects do the same, but I'd like to create my own configuration and elements. 

### Current features.

- Responsive header.
- Dropdown menu with cool animations.
- Search input.
- Basic content structure (left and right modules).
- Basic Footer.

### Future improvements.
 
If you're a developer, feel free to use my code. And if you have some ideas and feedback, please, open an issue or write me an email: <dividirporcero@gmail.com>. Would be awesome to hear your ideas ;).
